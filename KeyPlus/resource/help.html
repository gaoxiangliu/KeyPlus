                    This program is relating to the keyboard. It can record the keystrokes of your keyboard and give you the 
                    statistics list as well as an intuitive keystrokes heat map. It can also serve as a 104 keys keyboard testing utility.
                     Another useful function is the key assignment, in which you can define system hotkeys to perform some tasks like 
                     control system volume and execute some programs etc. Besides, you can test and improve typing speed with this 
                     program. Another interesting function is simulating the sound of a mechanical keyboard, this is an entertaining 
                     function that tends to increase typing pleasure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you find any bug in this program, please feel free to contact the developer. The program is open-sourced, 
                    you can check how does it work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hope this program is easy to use even without reading the instruction. But it is recommended to read if you want 
                    to gain better experiences. This instruction will introduce some tips and things you should know about. 
                    This instruction does not include a very simple function, so it won't be too long to read.

                    Keystrokes statistics is the basic function of this program. After running the program, it will record your 
                    keystrokes automatically. Feel free to minimize the main window of the program. It will record your keystrokes 
                    in the background.
                </p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <div class="warning_text">NOTICE</div>
                    If you exit this program by clicking the "Exit" menu item, the keystrokes won't be recorded. 
                    If you can see the icon on the tray of the taskbar, this program is running in the background, and keystrokes 
                    will be recorded. 
                    By default, this program will run automatically on Windows startup. You can change this by clicking 
                    "Preference" -> "Settings". Also notice that keystrokes may not work properly under some circumstances,
                     like in VMWare virtual machines.
                </div>
                <p>Total keystrokes are the keystrokes statistics from the time you install this program.</p>
                <p>Current keystrokes are the keystrokes statistics from the time you run this program.</p>
                <p>
                    Only total keystrokes will be stored in a file. So, if the current keystroke statistics are important to you, 
                    make sure to save the statistics by clicking "Statistics List" -> "Export."
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can switch the two statistics mode by clicking the radio buttons or select from the menu. You can also select
                     your favorite color tone for the keystrokes statistics heat map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Refresh mode is when the keystrokes heat map will be updated. In "Delay" mode, it will be updated along with saving 
                    the total keystrokes statistics file. The saving interval can be changed in "Preference" -> "Settings". The default 
                    interval is 10 minutes. In "Real-Time" mode, it will be updated right after each keystroke.
                </p>

                    This program only supports 104 keys or fewer QWERTY keyboards. If your keyboard has more than 104 keys, 
                    some of the keys may not be recorded. If your keyboard is in not QWERTY layout, this program may not be 
                    suitable for you.

                    Keystroke statistics can be versatile in real life. For example, it gives you an overview of the using 
                    frequency of keys, so you can know which keys are frequently used. (So, if you are a keyboard manufacturer,
                     you may consider strengthening the frequently used keys.) Also, you can know which letter is the most 
                     frequently used letter in English. (E of course.) Another example is that if you are using non-English 
                     language IME, you can compare the efficiency of different IMEs by looking at the keystrokes heat map. 
                     An effective non-English IME should avoid the keys like Q, Z, O, and P, etc. (They are difficult to press down.) 
                     Also, you can check which keys are frequently used in a game. The possibilities are infinite.

                <p id="typing_speed" class="title">Typing Speed Test</p>
                <p>
                    You can go to "Skill Tests" -> "Typing Speed (WPM)" to test your typing speed. It is also a very 
                    good tool to improve your typing speed. The words are frequently used in English. So, just practice.
                    And these words help with improving typing speed in daily lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The unit of typing speed in English is WPM, or words per minute. Here comes the question, how to define the 
                    term "word"? How many letters in a word? Here, the length of a word is 5 characters. (Note, "characters" not 
                    "letters".) A character includes letters, punctuation, and space. Yes, between words, there is a space, which 
                    will also be counted into input provided it is valid. For example, if your WPM is 80, that means your valid 
                    input characters are 400 this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, how to define valid characters? If you type a word correctly and press down the space bar, the number of 
                    the letters in the word, as well as space, are the valid characters. For example, you input the testing word "girl" 
                    correctly, these are 5 valid characters that will be included in calculating WPM. On the other hand, if you make an even 
                    tiny typo for a word, all the characters (including space) are invalid. Using the example "girl" again, if 
                    you type "gril", "girle", "gir" and then press down the space bar, the 5 characters won't be included in 
                    WPM. It is obvious that valid and invalid characters depend on the testing words, they have nothing to do 
                    with how many times you press down the keys. (for you may make typos)
                </p>
                <p>
                    So much about calculating WPM. Let us take a look at the calculation of accuracy. You may think accuracy is the
                    ratio of the number of valid characters (described above) and the total characters of testing words. Unfortunately, 
                    this is not the case! Accuracy relating to how many times you press down the keys. And the term "total keystrokes" 
                    and "valid (invalid) keystrokes" are introduced. Whenever you are supposed to press down a key, a correct 
                    keystroke is expected. For example, you are about to input the testing word "girl". At this time, the expected 
                    keystroke is G on the keyboard. If you finish input this word, the expected keystroke is the space bar. If you make some 
                    mistakes in the middle of a word, for example, you type "jri" (all three letters are wrong), and then the expected 
                    keystroke is still L (not G). Even though you correct the letters before pressing down the space bar, the invalid 
                    keystrokes will still be counted. So, your accuracy will still be affected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some tips about practicing typing speed. First, adjusting your sitting posture, you may use a comfortable 
                    desk and chair. Also, sit straight. It is hard to say which posture is correct for using a computer, but you should 
                    have to find a posture that is healthy and comfortable for you. Second, your keyboard. Membrane keyboards are 
                    horrible in terms of feeling, but it does not mean that the typing speed is slow. Mechanical keyboards feel good when 
                    typing, and they could give you a better experience if you using the keyboard a lot. It is hard to say which kind of 
                    switch is better, for all of them are good and they are suitable for different people. So, you may need to find 
                    which type of switch you prefer. Generally, the clicky and tactile switch is suitable for typing, because they have the 
                    feedback which helps with reducing typos, while the linear switch is suitable for gaming (One may have more typos with a 
                    linear switch). But, again, different people have different feelings. Last, the most important tip is how to 
                    practice. Accuracy is very important in almost any case. So, don't concentrate only on the value of WPM. Don't be 
                    so anxious to improve WPM and try to type fast, but it turns out that you make lots of typos. Mistakes 
                    contribute to reducing WPM dramatically and disturbing your typing pace and mood. So, pay more attention to accuracy. 
                    You are recommended to concentrate when typing. And type at the maximum speed under the condition that your accuracy 
                    is at least 96% (98% is recommended). After a while, you will find that your typing speed is improved linearly.

                <p class="question">Is the program safe?</p>
                <p class="answer">- Absolutely! It is open-sourced, you can check how does it work.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Why does my anti-virus software reports this program?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    - It may because of file reading and writing and register modifying. This program will only read and write files under
                     the directory "KeybaordStatistics" at your Windows user Document directory.
                </p>
                <p class="answer">- As for register, it is only for running this program automatically on Windows startup.</p>
                <p class="answer">- It is totally fine to add this program to the trust list.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Will my key activities be uploaded online?</p>
                <p class="answer">- Absolutely no. It will only store on your local machine.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Why I cannot see the main window after clicking the icon on the system tray?</p>
                <p class="answer">- You can right-click the icon on the system tray, and select Center Window Position or Left Upper Window Position.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Why this program doesn't record keystrokes sometimes?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    - As mentioned before, this program only monitor keystrokes on higher-level in the OS. Some other programs may 
                    intercept the keyboard input at lower-level, which cannot be captured by this program.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Why the program cannot distinguish two Enter keys?</p>
                <p class="answer">- This porgram monitor keystrokes on higher-level in the OS, and for Windows, these two Enter keys share the same key code.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Why the keystrokes heat map does not refresh?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    - Keystrokes heat map will be refreshed instantly under "Real-time" Mode, but it may consume more CPU resources when the window is visible. 
                    (When window is minimized, it won't consume much.) So, if you want to see the dynamic change of the keystrokes heat map, make sure to use 
                    "Real-time" Mode. In the "Delayed" Mode, heat map will only be refreshed along with saving keystrokes statistics file.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Why can't I press down several keys simultaneously?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    - It is because of your keyboard. For most of the mechanical keyboards, there is no problem to press down all the keys simultaneously.
                    But, you can only press down only a few keys together on a membrane keyboard.
