# KeyPlus
This program can record your keystrokes and show the heat map of keystrokes in different color tones, which gives you an idea about which keys are frequently used. You can also test your keyboard and test your typing speed and customize shortcut keys for the system. Plus, more interesting functions like the simulation of mechanical keyboard sound.

## Keystrokes recording
Keystroke statistics can be versatile in real life. For example, it gives you an overview of the using frequency of keys, so you can know which keys are frequently used. (So, if you are a keyboard manufacturer, you may consider strengthening the frequently used keys.) Also, you can know which letter is the most frequently used letter in English. (E of course.) Another example is that if you are using non-English language IME, you can compare the efficiency of different IMEs by looking at the keystrokes heat map. An effective non-English IME should avoid the keys like Q, Z, O, and P, etc. (They are difficult to press down.) Also, you can check which keys are frequently used in a game. The possibilities are infinite. 

Your keystrokes will be recorded in the background, and the keystrokes heat map will tell you which keys are frequently used.

There are lots of available color otnes for the heat map. And you can also view and export the detailed statistics of keystrokews.

Total keystrokes are the statistics from the time you install this program; current keystrokes will be reseted next time you run this program.

Keystrokes will be recorded on running the program, and it will continue recording in the background unless you exit the program. So, feel free to minimize the main window.

## Key assignments
You can define your system shortcut keys to perform the tasks like control the system volume, execute programs and call the main windows of this program etc. This function is extremely nifty if you assign the shortcut keys for you frequently programs, and you can open them just by pressing down the shortcut keys.

## Skill tests
### Typing speed test (WPM)
WPM stands for Words-Per-Minute, which measures the English typing speed. The length of words is 5 characters. According to Google, the average typing speed is 40 WPM. Do you know your typing speed and are you faster than 40 WPM? Go and have a try! This tool is fast to load compared with online tesing tool, so, it is very convenient for practicing typing. Also, many test words sets are available to be selected, and you are allowed to custimze your own test words set. Please focus more on accuracy and times of using backspace key when practicing. For more tips of typing and how to measure WPM, please view the help documentation.

Just keep practicing, high typing speed means you can reply the emails faster, write faster, code faster and so on. You can save lots of time in the computerized society.
### Mouse clicking speed test (CPS)
### Spacebar speed test

## Mechanical keyboard simulation
16 types of switchses are available. Even if you don't have a mechanical keyboard, you can still enjoy the typing sound.
Note: different computers and different state of computer will give you different experience for this function. Sometimes, sound lag may occur.
